# PoS Decentralized Computing Project

This project implements a decentralized computing platform using a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. The platform is built with Golang and leverages gRPC for efficient communication between nodes.

## Features

- **Decentralized Computing**: Distribute computing tasks across multiple nodes in a decentralized network.
- **Proof of Stake (PoS) Consensus**: Ensure network security and efficiency using a PoS consensus mechanism.
- **Golang**: Utilize the robustness and performance of Golang for the core implementation.
- **gRPC Communication**: Achieve efficient and scalable communication between nodes with gRPC.
